# Counter app
The app is designed to help count people entering different establishments. It is connected to an online database and could be used by multiple people (potentially at different entrances) and automatically updates so that all devices are in sync at all times.
# Code
Its written in Java with Android Studio. Im using an online server with cPanel where I wrote PHP files to fetch data from the MySQL database and send it back to the app.
